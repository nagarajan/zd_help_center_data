The tracker will display updated mileage every time the vehicle is turned off for every 5 miles driven.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><a name=\"tracking\"></a></p>\n<h3>Tracking personal miles and extra mileage</h3>\n<p>While offline and not in Driver Mode, swipe up on the main screen of your Lyft Driver app to track how many personal miles you have driven. This includes an updated timestamp of the last mileage reading.</p>\n<p>If you begin to accrue Extra Mileage fees, the fee amount (plus tax) will be added to your rental hold for the current week. This can be tracked in your Earnings tab.</p>\n<p>If you go over the mileage limit, you will receive an Extra Mileage fee. This Extra Mileage fee will supply additional personal miles.

This means when you’re online, you should receive more rides and be able to earn more per hour. Plus, you’ll spend less time waiting for your next ride.</p>\n<p>During periods of low demand, you may have to wait to go online or drive to a busier area, but we’ll show you where and when to drive to maximize your earnings.</p>\n<p><strong>With priority driving</strong>, you can go online whenever and wherever you want. You'll see real-time, in-app tracking of your acceptance rate and the number of rides you've given in the last 30 days.</p>\n<p>Drivers will be added to the priority driving list in real time, and removed on a daily basis if they no longer meet requirements. You’ll receive an in-app notification letting you know when your status has changed.</p>\n<p>Learn how priority driving works and see tips for going online below.</p>\n<p><strong>Skip to:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#priority\" target=\"_self\">How priority driving works in New York City</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#open\" target=\"_self\">How online zones work</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#tips\" target=\"_self\">Tips for going and staying online</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#airports\" target=\"_self\">About airport queues</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#faq\" target=\"_self\">Frequently asked questions</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>\n<a name=\"priority\"></a>How priority driving works in New York City</h4>\n<p>Drivers who maintain an <strong>acceptance rate of 90% or above</strong> and have completed <strong>180 rides in the last 30 days</strong> can drive whenever and wherever they want.
