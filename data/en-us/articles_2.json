Lyft drivers like you are in a unique position to help riders with service animals get around effortlessly in their community — thanks for taking this seriously, and being there when people need your rides the most.</p>\n<h3>\n<a name=\"faq\"></a>FAQ for Drivers</h3>\n<h4>\n<a name=\"definition\"></a>What is a service animal?</h4>\n<p>Service animals are working animals, not pets. Service animals undergo extensive training to assist individuals with disabilities. They help blind people travel, alert deaf people to sounds, protect persons who are having a seizure, and perform many other tasks to help individuals with disabilities.</p>\n<p>Service animals are not required to wear a tag or vest or be registered. Riders with service animals do not need to display any kind of proof that their animal is a service animal. In other words, if a rider with a dog says it is a service animal, the driver should transport the rider.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><a href=\"#top\" target=\"_self\">Back to top</a></p>\n<h4>\n<a name=\"rights\"></a>As an independent contractor, isn’t it my choice to accommodate service animals?</h4>\n<p>We created Lyft for people who love flexibility and freedom, and that’s still the case. But even independent contractors have to follow the law. For example, it’s Lyft policy and the law that you and your riders wear a seatbelt while driving for Lyft. Similarly, it’s Lyft policy and the law that you accommodate service animals.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><a href=\"#top\" target=\"_self\">Back to top</a></p>\n<h4>\n<a name=\"consequences\"></a>What are the consequences for refusing to take a rider with a service animal?</h4>\n<p>If a driver refuses a rider with a service animal, the driver could face immediate and permanent deactivation if an investigation into the alleged denial verifies a wrongful denial.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><a href=\"#top\" target=\"_self\">Back to top</a></p>\n<h4>\n<a name=\"how_can_i_tell\"></a>How can I tell if a service animal is a true service animal? What if I think a passenger is misrepresenting their dog as a service animal?</h4>\n<p>The good news is that cases of service-animal fraud are rare in our community and will put passengers at risk of deactivation. But if you want, you may ask two questions of riders who report their animals are service animals: (1) Is the animal required because of a disability? And (2) what work or task has the animal been trained to perform? These questions will usually prove to you that the animal in question is a service animal.</p>\n<p>That said, we don’t want you to risk your own deactivation by guessing incorrectly. Some passengers use service animals for reasons that aren’t obvious, like epilepsy or heart conditions. Not all service animals wear tags, and they come in all shapes and sizes. For these reasons, it’s best that you accommodate animals when they’re reported to you by riders as being service animals.</p>\n<p>If you have a question about the policy, or would like to report a rider who you suspect is abusing the policy, you should contact Lyft Support and the <a href=\"#report\" target=\"_self\">Service Animal Hotline</a> <strong>after</strong> you’ve completed the ride.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><a href=\"#top\" target=\"_self\">Back to top</a></p>\n<h4>\n<a name=\"driver_service_animal\"></a>I’m a driver with a service animal — what are the rules?</h4>\n<p>It’s Lyft’s policy that drivers are permitted to ride with their service animals. However, this may limit the number of passengers you can carry, and some passengers may be uncomfortable or allergic around your service animal and will ask you to cancel their request. It’s advised that you call the passenger in advance to notify them of the service animal. If they’re unable to ride with your service animal, you must cancel the ride so they can request another driver. Pro-tip: If the request came from nearby, sign out of driver mode for a minute so that you don't receive the passenger's next request.</p>\n<p>To report a Service Animal Policy violation, call <a href=\"tel:1-844-554-1297\" target=\"_self\">1-844-554-1297</a> or select 'Contact Support' at the bottom of this page.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><a href=\"#top\" target=\"_self\">Back to top</a></p>\n<h4>\n<a name=\"shared_rides\"></a>What about Shared Lyft? What if a rider in my Shared Lyft has an allergy or objection to the service animal?</h4>\n<p>Passengers who request a Shared Lyft should be aware they are more than likely to be riding in a closed environment with another person. Sometimes that means encountering a service animal, just like you might in an elevator, an airplane, or small office.</p>\n<p>If a rider’s allergies or objections to the service animal are severe, the rider may ask to request a different ride. If necessary, you may cancel the non-service animal rider’s ride without penalty. If you ever have a problem as a driver — or concerns about your rating — reach out to Lyft through the Help Center and we’ll guide you through it after the ride.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><a href=\"#top\" target=\"_self\">Back to top</a></p>\n<h4>\n<a name=\"no_room\"></a>What if there’s no room on a Shared Lyft for a service animal?</h4>\n<p>Service animals often ride at their owners’ feet, so you shouldn’t need an extra seat. If they do, we’ve found that other passengers are understanding and will make room for them when necessary. (Note: It’s rare that a Shared Lyft will be at capacity at the same time you get a request from someone with a service animal. It’s also rare that you’ll get a ride with a service animal to begin with.)</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><a href=\"#top\" target=\"_self\">Back to top</a></p>\n<h4>\n<a name=\"non_service_animals\"></a>Am I required to transport animals that aren’t service animals?</h4>\n<p>If you ask the two questions above and the rider tells you that the animal is not a service animal, you have control to cancel the ride and let support know — it won’t impact your cancel rating.</p>\n<p>Although we encourage you to take all animals, emotional support animals aren't covered under our Service Animal Policy or the law so you’re not required to accommodate them.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><a href=\"#top\" target=\"_self\">Back to top</a></p>\n<h4>\n<a name=\"best_way\"></a>What’s the best way to transport a service animal?</h4>\n<p>Many service animals are trained to ride in vehicles, or sit on the floor of the rear seat. Some drivers like to carry a towel or blanket in their vehicle, and place these items on the seats to protect them.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><a href=\"#top\" target=\"_self\">Back to top</a></p>\n<h4>\n<a name=\"report\"></a>How do I report a service animal problem?</h4>\n<p>Call the Service Animal Hotline at <a href=\"tel:1-844-554-1297\" target=\"_self\">1-844-554-1297</a> and we’ll assist you. Passengers and drivers who prefer to report a problem in writing may select 'Contact Support' below.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><a href=\"#top\" target=\"_self\">Back to top</a></p>\n<p><strong style=\"font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;\">See also:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://lyft-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/helpcenter/Policies/service_animal_user_guide.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">User Guide for Riders with Service Animals</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://lyft-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/helpcenter/Policies/service_animal_policy.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Lyft’s Platform Service Animal Policy For Riders</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/lyft-assets/helpcenter/Policies/service_animal_rider_pamphlet.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Rider Pamphlet - Riding with Service Animals</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://help.lyft.com/hc/en-us/articles/115012923767\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Anti-discrimination policies</a></li>\n</ul>\n<div id=\"customNewRequest\" data-replace-id=\"new-request-btn\" data-form-id=\"813147\"> </div>"

Tap ‘Submit’ for each passenger to save any changes you make. Ratings below 4 or 5 means the passenger wasn't up to par, so we want to know why. Use the comment box to leave passenger feedback. Passengers don't see this feedback, only us. Rating 3 or lower means you won’t be matched with this passenger again.</p>\n<p>You can also edit passenger ratings from your ride history for 24 hours after drop-off. To do this, view the ride and tap ‘Rate passengers.’</p>\n<h4> </h4>\n<h4>Change a passenger rating or add feedback</h4>\n<p>If you experienced a safety-related incident or emergency situation, see <a href=\"https://help.lyft.com/hc/en-us/articles/115013077888\">steps for calling us to report it</a>.

Your ride count, ratings, and time spent with Lyft will be displayed.</p>\n<p>Your rating is calculated as the average of your last 100 rides, or however many you’ve taken if that number is below 100. Drivers rate each ride, and your rating is the average of those ratings.</p>\n<h3> </h3>\n<h4>Why rating says \"new\"</h4>\n<p>This means you have fewer than 100 rides.</p>\n<h3> </h3>\n<h4>Why a rating is X.XX</h4>\n<p>Drivers rate riders after each ride. Your rating reflects the average of your last 100 rides, or of all your rides if you have completed fewer than 100 rides during your time with Lyft.</p>\n<p>If you’d like to be the best passenger possible, check out our <a href=\"https://www.lyft.com/safety/community-guidelines\">Community Guidelines</a> for some pro tips!</p>\n<center>\n<p><a href=\"#top\">Back to top</a></p>\n</center><hr>\n<h2>\n<a name=\"unfair\"></a>About unfair ratings</h2>\n<p>Occasionally, drivers may have passengers who rate poorly when drivers might not deserve it, like if you rightly refused to let a rider bring an open container of alcohol in your car. If you feel a passenger may rate you poorly due to something out of your control, use the comment box after the ride is over to tell us anything you feel is important about the ride or passenger. These comments let us see your side of the story if we need to investigate later. </p>\n<center>\n<p><a href=\"#top\">Back to top</a></p>\n</center>\n<h4>See also:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://help.lyft.com/hc/en-us/articles/115012926847\">How drivers and passengers are paired</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://help.lyft.com/hc/en-us/articles/115013081708\">Keeping your car clean</a></li>\n</ul>"

Potential U.S. drivers must provide a <strong>valid social security number</strong> in order to undergo the criminal background check, which is conducted by a third-party company, Checkr, Inc.

How are background checks affected by COVID-19?</strong></p>\n<p>Some background checks may be delayed due to court and DMV closures caused by COVID-19. If your background check is affected by these closures, you may be unable to go online or receive ride requests until your background check is completed. You can check the status of your background check by logging in to the <a href=\"https://applicant.checkr.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Checkr applicant portal</a>.</p>\n<p>We will continue to conduct continuous criminal monitoring and driving record monitoring of active drivers.</p>\n<p><strong>2. How long will my background check take?</strong></p>\n<p>Typically, background check results will be available within 2-4 days. However, searches at the county level are subject to the availability of records from county courthouses. Some of these courts lack electronic records access, are understaffed, or are closed because of COVID-19, which can cause background checks to take several weeks to complete. You can check the status of your background check by logging in to the <a href=\"https://applicant.checkr.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Checkr applicant portal</a>.<br> <br> <strong>3. I received a copy of my background check, but it is incorrect. I was not charged with the offense listed, or there is something inaccurate or incomplete about the information in the report. What should I do?</strong></p>\n<p>If you believe that the contents of your background check are inaccurate or incomplete, you may contact Checkr, Inc. (the company that provided the background check to Lyft) directly by phone at <a href=\"tel:1-844-824-3257\" target=\"_self\">844-824-3257</a> or by using the <a href=\"https://applicant.checkr.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Checkr applicant portal</a>.</p>\n<p>Please note that there is no time limit on when you can dispute the accuracy of your report with Checkr, but we encourage you to do so as soon as possible.</p>\n<p><strong>4. I received a copy of my background check, and it is accurate. However, I believe there was an error. I do not believe I should be disqualified from driving for Lyft based on my criminal history. What should I do?</strong></p>\n<p>If the information contained in your background check is correct, <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">but you still </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">have questions or would like to provide us with additional information</span>, <a href=\"https://help.lyft.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=724707\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">contact Lyft support directly</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>5. It seems like Lyft’s background check criteria may vary by region. Why?</strong></p>\n<p>State and local laws vary significantly. Some jurisdictions require Lyft to disqualify applicants with certain records, while others do not require disqualification for those same records. To comply with applicable laws, the criteria Lyft uses to evaluate an applicant’s criminal history often varies by jurisdiction.</p>\n<p><strong>6. I have applied to provide services on several “gig economy” platforms. My background check passed for those companies, but I was disqualified from driving for Lyft based on my criminal history. Why?</strong></p>\n<p>Laws governing “gig economy” companies may vary depending on the type of service being provided. Also, keep in mind that potential drivers’ background checks must comply with Lyft’s internal safety standards, which may be more strict than regulatory standards or the criteria of other platforms.</p>\n<p><strong>7. I have been driving for Lyft, but I was notified that I need to pass another background check to keep driving. Why? I already passed a background check when I initially applied.</strong></p>\n<p>Lyft conducts background checks routinely on all active drivers to ensure continued compliance with applicable laws and safety regulations. Lyft may also conduct an additional background check if you move from one driving region to another.</p>\n<p><strong>8. I have been driving for Lyft for several years and have passed two background checks in that time. After my most recent background check was run, I was notified that I have been deactivated because of the criminal history contained in my background check. I do not have any recent convictions, and the only conviction I have is from many, many years ago. Why did this happen and what should I do?</strong></p>\n<p>This result may have occurred for several reasons. For example, some state and local laws restrict how far back a conviction can be reported to us. If you have recently moved from one of these jurisdictions to a state with no reporting restrictions, an older disqualifying offense may have surfaced in your background check. We understand how frustrating this can be. If you have been driving for Lyft and are subsequently deactivated for an offense that occurred prior to your initial application, please <a href=\"https://help.lyft.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=724707\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">contact Lyft directly</a> and provide us with more information.</p>\n<p><strong>9. I am unable to access the Lyft platform due to my background check. Why?</strong></p>\n<p>This may have occurred for several reasons. Your background check may have resulted in an error, or it may require further action. Please <a href=\"https://help.lyft.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=724707\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">contact us</a> to find out more.</p>\n<p><strong>10. My ID Validation failed. Why? What does this mean?</strong></p>\n<p>All Social Security Numbers (SSN) are validated against multiple databases to ensure that the SSN matches the user applying to drive with Lyft.</p>\n<p><strong>11. My background check is ‘suspended’. What does that mean?</strong></p>\n<p>Your background check may require additional action with Checkr. You should have received an email from no-reply@checkr.com with instructions, or you can log-in to the <a href=\"https://applicant.checkr.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Checkr applicant portal</a> to view your status.</p>\n<p><strong>12. I have been driving for Lyft, but now I cannot access driver mode. I was told that I need to consent to a new background check. How do I do that?</strong></p>\n<p>If you are not receiving a consent pop-up when you log in to the driver app, the disclosure and consent form may be located under the notifications tab in your app.</p>\n<center>\n<p><a href=\"#top\">Back to top</a></p>\n</center><hr>\n<h2>\n<a name=\"communitysafetyeducation\"></a>Community Safety Education program</h2>\n<p>Lyft is committed to holding each other accountable.

One option for Riders is to request a ride from rideshare drivers who are driving to or through those destinations (“Drivers”)(collectively “Users”). Users authorize Lyft to match them with a Driver or Rider based on factors such as location, the estimated time to pickup, destination, user preferences, and platform efficiency, and to cancel an existing match and rematch based on the same considerations. In certain markets, Riders may also have the option to rent bikes or scooters through the Lyft Platform to ride to their destination. In some markets these bikes and scooters are owned by Lyft. In other markets Lyft operates a bike-share or scooter-share program on behalf of third parties.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lyft does not provide transportation services, and Lyft is not a transportation carrier.

They can only to be used:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>To go from Point A to Point B.</strong> No errands, stops, or changes to pickup or drop-off locations.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>For parties of 1 or 2.</strong> Larger groups should request a standard Lyft or <a href=\"https://help.lyft.com/hc/en-us/articles/115012927007\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Lyft XL</a> ride.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>When you're ready to go.</strong> Since there may be other riders depending on you, drivers will not wait more than one minute at your pickup location.</li>\n</ul>\n<center>\n<p><a href=\"#top\">Back to top</a></p>\n</center><hr>\n<h2>\n<a name=\"sharing\"></a>Sharing your ride</h2>\n<p>Our goal for Shared rides is to fill the empty seats in cars with riders going in the same direction. <a href=\"#chaining\">Chaining</a> brings us one step closer to achieving that goal by pairing multiple parties together in one ride.</p>\n<p>It's<strong> important</strong> that you only request Shared rides for <strong>one or two riders</strong> and accurately choose the number of people in the app. If you don't follow this rule, the driver will be prompted to cancel your ride upon arrival.</p>\n<center>\n<p><a href=\"#top\">Back to top</a></p>\n</center><hr>\n<h2>\n<a name=\"chaining\"></a>How chaining works</h2>\n<p>Shared ride chaining allows us to use the open seats in the car to their full advantage. As a passenger, you may be paired with multiple riders along your route.</p>\n<p>The pickup and drop-off order can vary with every ride. Sometimes, you'll be the first passenger dropped off, and other times, you'll be the last. It's all based on the most efficient route chosen by our system. The driver should always follow the instructions in the app, and we ask that you be respectful of that.</p>\n<center>\n<p><a href=\"#top\">Back to top</a></p>\n</center><hr>\n<h2>\n<a name=\"sharedpricing\"></a>Shared ride pricing</h2>\n<p>A Shared ride is always cheaper than the same in a standard Lyft. Discount amounts depend on your city, the likelihood for getting matched, and current driver supply. The Lyft app will show you the price up front: what you see is what you pay regardless of whether you're matched with other riders.</p>\n<p>Riders in cities where Shared rides are available can estimate trip costs by using the built-in estimator for this ride mode. To see a Shared trip estimate:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Open the app, then tap 'Shared' (check our <a href=\"https://www.lyft.com/rider/cities\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Cities page</a> for riders to see if your region has Shared rides)</li>\n<li>Enter your pickup and drop-off locations by either typing the address or moving the map pin</li>\n<li>That's it! You'll see a guaranteed price for the Shared ride and also an estimated price for a standard Lyft in strikethrough text.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If you request a Shared ride, you'll be charged the guaranteed amount, which is shown in bold. You may also leave the Shared request screen by tapping the close button and request a standard Lyft. Keep in mind that fares in a standard Lyft may change due to traffic, weather, or other factors.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><a href=\"#top\">Back to top</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h2>\n<a name=\"conduct\"></a>Conduct in a Shared ride</h2>\n<p>Because there's the high probability of sharing a Shared ride with another party or two, we ask that you be considerate toward other riders. This includes leaving any pets at home (excluding service animals) and not taking up too much space with luggage or baggage.</p>\n<p>We want the experience to be fun, pleasant, and safe for everyone, so be mindful of your language and conduct. We also suggest that if you're traveling with a small child in a carseat or have a large group that you request a standard Lyft or Lyft XL.</p>\n<center>\n<p><a href=\"#top\">Back to top</a></p>\n</center><hr>\n<h2>\n<a name=\"rate\"></a>Can riders rate each other?</h2>\n<p>At this time, riders can only rate the driver and not the other riders in the ride.</p>\n<p>If you experience any problems or have additional feedback about the ride or other riders, tap 'Contact Support' below. We'll make sure it's taken care of.</p>\n<center>\n<p><a href=\"#top\">Back to top</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h2 class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\">\n<a name=\"saver\"></a>Shared Saver rides</h2>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\">Shared Saver rides work similarly to Shared rides, and guarantee the lowest possible price.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\">These rides may involve a short walk to the pick up location or from the drop-off location. You won’t always have to walk to the pick up location, but when you do, it will never exceed a 5 minute walk from your current location.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\">Shared Saver rides take a few extra minutes to be matched with a driver. We use the extra time to find riders along your route, which keeps prices low.</p>\n<h4 class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\">How to use Shared Saver:</h4>\n<ol>\n<li class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\">Select ‘Shared Saver’ from the ‘Shared’ tab of the ride mode selection screen.</li>\n<li class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\">Once you’re matched with a driver, walk to the pick up location designated in the app.</li>\n</ol>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\">While we do not offer <a href=\"https://help.lyft.com/hc/en-us/articles/115013080828\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">commuter benefits</a> for Shared Saver rides at this time, we plan to do so in the near future.</p>\n<p><a href=\"#top\">Back to top</a></p>\n</center>\n<h4>See also:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://help.lyft.com/hc/en-us/articles/115012926147\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">How to navigate a ride </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://help.lyft.com/hc/en-us/articles/115012926987\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Shared ride driver pay</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://help.lyft.com/hc/en-us/articles/115013080308\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">How to estimate a Lyft ride's cost</a></li>\n</ul>"

If they move it elsewhere, they get a pop-up notification asking them to confirm it's in the right place.</p>\n<p>Still, some passengers will purposefully place their pin away from their current location — whether to get a ride outside of a coverage zone or find a driver who's available — then give you a call and ask to be picked up elsewhere.</p>\n<p>Inaccurate pin drops throw off the system and can put you at risk of a citation if you agree to a pickup outside our coverage area.</p>\n<p>Protect yourself and help the community by educating these passengers about the proper use of Lyft. Here's what you can do:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ask the passenger to cancel, then re-request with the correct pin placement.

And, as always, you should never drive a group of passengers whose group exceeds the number of seat belts in your car.</p>\n<p>In order to keep you busy, we'll still dispatch regular requests to you, but only if there aren't also Lyft XL requests being made.</p>\n<h4>See also:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://help.lyft.com/hc/en-us/articles/115013080308\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">How to estimate a Lyft ride's cost</a></li>\n</ul>"

All preventative maintenance is included in your rental rate.</p>\n<p><strong>What to do</strong>: Go to a <a href=\"https://www.lyft.com/drive/expressdrive/service-locations\">service location</a> in your area that is authorized by Lyft. If you’re renting an electric vehicle, contact us for a list of authorized service locations. When you arrive, show the vendor your ARI ID card. The ARI ID card provides the Flexdrive Roadside Assistance phone number (<a href=\"tel:1-833-274-5938\">1-833-274-5938</a>) and should be included in the glovebox of your rental.

You should head directly to the nearest charging station if you have less than 40-50 miles of battery charge remaining.</p>\n<p><strong>How to charge: </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can find the closest charging station by opening the Plugshare app (or Electrify America app for Denver renters) that you downloaded during onboarding. From the app's home screen:</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Open ‘Map Filters’ (tap the funnel icon at the lower right hand side)</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Scroll down to review ‘Networks’ first. Deselect all options, leaving only the Charging Partners specified during your Flexdrive onboarding</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Scroll up to then review ‘Plugs.’ Deselect all options, leaving only “CCS/SAE”</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Make sure ‘Location Filters’ is set to include “Public Locations” and “In Use Locations” and “Requires Fee”</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Close ‘Map Filters’ to see the available charging stations in your area</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>How to charge: </strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For EVgo or ChargePoint, just use the RFID charging card attached to your rental keys to pay for charging at specified stations.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For Electrify America, use the Electrify America App that you downloaded during onboarding to find a nearby charging station and start charging by following the prompts on the screen and in the Electrify America App.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Note: Make sure to only use the Charging Partner specified in your rental agreement. Different regions have different Charging Partners. Your EV can charge on other networks outside of the Charging Partners in your region, but you may need to pay for charging at these locations.</span></p>\n<h4>Damage and repairs</h4>\n<p><strong>Examples</strong>: Body damage, cracked headlights, cracked windshields, etc.</p>\n<p><strong>What to do</strong>: Go to the branch where you picked up your Flexdrive rental. If the damage prevents driving (such as a brakes or transmission issue), call <a href=\"tel:1-833-274-5938\">1-833-274-5938</a> and follow prompts for roadside assistance.</p>\n<p><strong>Your cost</strong>: You may be charged for damages if you're found to be at fault.

Be ready to accept the next request instead, and consider moving to a better coverage area.</p>\n<h2>I missed a request that never showed</h2>\n<p>If you're receiving notifications that you missed requests but were never prompted to accept them, it's likely due to poor connectivity area for your carrier.

(\"Lyft\") has designed and developed a Lyft Beta Program (\"Lyft Beta Program\") to, among other things, allow a limited number of people to download test versions of Lyft applications for mobile devices (the “Experimental Software”), such as the Lyft for Android or Lyft for iOS applications, and to provide feedback and comments to Lyft regarding use of such applications. By joining the Lyft Beta Program, you agree to be bound by the terms and conditions set forth below (the \"Agreement\").</p>\n<p>1. Your Feedback By enrolling in the Lyft Beta Program you will have the ability to: (a) download, test, evaluate and analyze the Experimental Software (b) and provide feedback, analysis, suggestions and comments to Lyft (including, but not limited to, bug reports and test results) (collectively, “Feedback”).</p>\n<p>By participating in the Lyft Beta Program, you agree that any Feedback you provide will become the property of Lyft and you agree that Lyft may use or otherwise exploit all or part of your feedback or any derivative thereof in any manner or media now known without any further remuneration, compensation or credit to you. You represent and warrant that you have right to enter into this Agreement and assign and grant the rights set forth herein, and that any Feedback which is provided by you hereunder is original work made solely by you and does not infringe any third party intellectual property rights.</p>\n<p>2. Confidentiality Confidential Information. The Lyft Beta Program is designed to assist Lyft in researching, analyzing and validating the usability and reliability of certain prospective product features (collectively, the “Purpose”). Lyft may disclose to you certain information (tangible or intangible) that you agree to treat as Confidential Information as set forth below. Definition. “Confidential Information” means all information disclosed by Lyft, including, without limitation, documents, designs, techniques, specifications, product plans, strategic information, existing or prospective business plans, existing or prospective product study or pilot test objectives and/or results, and other information related to the Purpose. Consistent with the foregoing, Lyft may also disclose Confidential Information related to certain unreleased and experimental product features or plans.</p>\n<p>Obligations Regarding Confidential Information. You agree to: (a) use Confidential Information only for the Purpose; (b) not disclose Confidential Information to any third parties (including the sharing of unreleased/experimental product images); and (c) use the same degree of care, but no less than a reasonable degree of care (including reasonable security measures), to prevent the unauthorized use, dissemination or publication of Confidential Information as you would use to protect your own confidential information of like nature.</p>\n<p>Remedies. You agree that any breach of this Agreement by you may result in irreparable harm to Lyft, for which damages would be an inadequate remedy and therefore, in addition to its rights and remedies otherwise available at law, Lyft shall be entitled to seek equitable relief, including injunction, in the event of such breach.</p>\n<p>3. No Compensation or Employment You acknowledge that you are participating in the Lyft Beta Program on a purely voluntary basis, as a means of assisting, and in consideration of the opportunity to assist Lyft to use, implement, and understand various facets of the Experimental Software. Lyft, at its sole discretion, may provide you compensation for your participation and/or Feedback but you acknowledge and agree that Lyft has no obligation to do so. In the event Lyft provides you any form of compensation, which such shall not exceed $200 USD, you represent and warrant that you will pay all applicable federal, state and local taxes based on any payments received by you. Lyft makes no guarantee or representation as to whether or not your Feedback regarding the Experimental Software will be used, and you understand and acknowledge that Lyft will not compensate you for your participation in the Lyft Beta Program. Furthermore, you acknowledge and agree that nothing in this Agreement or in your voluntary submission of Feedback creates any employment relationship between you and Lyft.</p>\n<p>Lyft may, in its sole discretion, at any time, terminate or discontinue the Lyft Beta Program, discontinue your participation in the Lyft Beta Program, or remove your Feedback. You acknowledge and agree that all such decisions by Lyft are final and Lyft will have no liability with respect to such decisions.</p>\n<p>5. Notices Unless otherwise set forth in this Agreement, Lyft may give general notices to you by posting on any Lyft web site (e.g., lyft.com) and, where possible, by electronic mail to your email address.</p>\n<p>6. No Warranty from Lyft YOU EXPRESSLY AGREE THAT YOUR PARTICIPATION IN THE LYFT BETA PROGRAM IS AT YOUR OWN RISK. THE LYFT BETA PROGRAM IS AVAILABLE ON AN \"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED.

SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO THE ABOVE EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. THIS LIMITED WARRANTY GIVES YOU SPECIFIC LEGAL RIGHTS, AND YOU MAY ALSO HAVE OTHER RIGHTS, WHICH VARY FROM STATE TO STATE.</p>\n<p>7. Limitations of Liability IN NO EVENT SHALL LYFT, ITS EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, ATTORNEYS, CONSULTANTS, OR CONTRACTORS BE LIABLE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT FOR ANY CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, LOST PROFITS, INDIRECT OR OTHER DAMAGES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF BUSINESS, COST OF COVER WHETHER BASED IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF LYFT HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES AND NOTWITHSTANDING ANY FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED REMEDY. IN ANY EVENT, LYFT’S, ITS EMPLOYEES’, AGENTS’, ATTORNEYS’, CONSULTANTS’ OR CONTRACTORS’ AGGREGATE LIABILITY UNDER THIS AGREEMENT FOR ANY CLAIM SHALL BE STRICTLY LIMITED TO $100.00.

You acknowledge that Lyft has entered into this Agreement in reliance upon the limitations of liability set forth herein and that the same is an essential basis of the bargain between the parties.</p>\n<p>8.

As members of the community platform, drivers and riders aren't entitled to benefits, worker's compensation, or unemployment insurance.</p>\n<p>Lyft is a peer-to-peer transportation platform, meaning drivers use their own cars to pick up passengers, who use the app to request a ride. Because Lyft is committed to safety and community, drivers go through a series of screenings, including background checks and car safety inspections.</p>\n<p>Lyft doesn't fit into the traditional taxi or limousine model. Our government relations team works hard to create regulations that fit the needs of drivers and passengers, and, most importantly, keep everyone safe.</p>\n<center>\n<p><a href=\"#top\">Back to top</a></p>\n</center><hr>\n<h2>\n<a name=\"proof\"></a>Proof of income</h2>\n<p>We've found that weekly pay statements or annual earnings will suffice for most cases (for example, loan applications).</p>\n<p>If you need to access a history of weekly pay statements, log in to the <a href=\"http://lyft.com/drive\">Dashboard</a> and tap <a href=\"https://www.lyft.com/drive/year\">'Driving History.'</a> From there you can view your summaries and earnings by ride, day, week, and year.</p>\n<center>\n<p><a href=\"#top\">Back to top</a></p>\n</center><hr>\n<h2 id=\"h_2107a6f6-7514-49a1-b41a-0a59a8a8ef15\"> <a name=\"taxinfodate\"></a>How to view and download tax info and 1099 forms</h2>\n<center>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We provide tax information for any given tax year by January 31st of the following year. </span></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your Annual Summary and any 1099 forms you qualified for (requirements </span><a href=\"#h_2107a6f6-7514-49a1-b41a-0a59a8a8ef15\" target=\"_self\">below</a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">) are available in your Driver Dashboard. </span></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\"><strong>To view or download using a computer:</strong></p>\n<ol class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\">\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Log into the Dashboard at </span><a href=\"https://lyft.com/login\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https://lyft.com/login</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span>\n</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Go to the 'Tax Information' tab</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Under the ‘Documents’ header, select ‘Download’ to download your Annual Summary or tax forms</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\"><strong>To view in your Lyft Driver app:</strong></p>\n<ol class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\">\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Open your Lyft Driver app</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tap your profile photo in the top left</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tap 'Dashboard'</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tap the menu icon in the top left</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tap 'Tax Information'</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Under the ‘Documents’ header, select ‘Download’ to view your Annual Summary or tax forms</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can switch between years using the pink links at the top of the page.

The app regularly sends location info to our servers, which also lets us measure the distance and time you've driven and calculate ride costs and earnings.</p>\n<p>To track rides accurately, we need the best location updates from your GPS while you're driving. Here’s how to make that happen.</p>\n<p><strong>Skip to:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#bestpractices\">Best practices</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#causes\">Causes of poor location tracking</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#enable\">How to enable location tracking</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>\n<a name=\"bestpractices\"></a>Best practices</h2>\n<p>Regardless of your device’s manufacturer, there are several things you can do to fix poor location tracking. Use the following tips to improve GPS accuracy:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Plug your phone in:</strong> Devices attempt to conserve battery when they're not charging. For some devices, running on battery alone may mean location tracking is poor. Always keep your phone plugged in, even when fully charged.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Turn on wifi and Bluetooth:</strong> Apple and Android devices use nearby wifi networks and Bluetooth signals to locate your device, especially when GPS signals are low. Turn wifi and Ask to Join Networks both on.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Use a phone mount:</strong> Location tracking works better when your phone has access to clear skies through a window. If your phone is in your center console or pocket, you may experience poor location tracking. We recommend mounting your device on the windshield or dashboard using a mount.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Close unused apps:</strong> Turn off any apps other than those you use to navigate with Lyft, especially apps that use your location in the background.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Keep your software and app current:</strong> Update to the latest phone software available. Apple and Android devices frequently release upgrades that may improve your phone’s location accuracy.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Buy a new phone:</strong> To get the most accurate GPS, we highly recommend upgrading to the newest phone model if you can. Older phones may have outdated GPS antennae, which can cause poor location tracking.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Don’t talk and drive:</strong> Avoid making phone calls on your Lyft-enabled device during a ride. Some networks don't allow data usage and phone usage at the same time.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Start and stop safely:</strong> Only start or stop your rides in the app when your car is completely stopped. Not only is this good safety sense, but stopping completely helps us track your location more accurately.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Wait a bit:</strong> GPS accuracy depends on the number of visible GPS satellites. Locating all visible satellites can take several minutes with accuracy gradually increasing as time goes by. Give your phone a minute or two to find these satellites before getting on the road.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Adjust your time settings:</strong> Make sure the date, time, and timezone are set correctly on your device. Go to Settings, General, then Date and Time. If possible, toggle your Date and Time to 'Set Automatically.' Incorrect computer settings can sync to your device so verify the date, time, and timezone on a computer that syncs with your device.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Always restart:</strong> Any time you've updated your software and app or even changed your settings, restart your device to give it a fresh restart. (We've all had to reboot our computers before!)</li>\n</ul>\n<center>\n<p><a href=\"#top\">Back to top</a></p>\n</center><hr>\n<h2>\n<a name=\"causes\"></a>Causes of poor location tracking</h2>\n<p>There are three main issues that can lead to inaccurate location data:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Incorrect phone settings</li>\n<li>Poor in-car phone placement</li>\n<li>Defective phones, (in rare cases)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In general, poor connectivity doesn't cause tracking problems because the app stores location points and sends them when network quality is better.</p>\n<center>\n<p><a href=\"#top\">Back to top</a></p>\n</center><hr>\n<h2><a name=\"enable\"></a></h2>\n<p>The first time you open the app, we'll send prompt you to let Lyft access your location.

Appointments are not necessary at the Chicago Driver Center.<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"></span></p>\n<p>Please bring the following with you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your vehicle</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Driver's license</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vehicle insurance</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vehicle registration*</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span>You can also set up an appointment through your Lyft app with one of our partner mechanics. No Lyft representatives will be present and driver will be responsible for inspection fees.</span></p>\n<p>Once your region has been changed and you log into driver mode, you'll automatically be sent a tax emblem via email within 24 — 48 hours. If you don't receive a tax emblem or need to grab your 311 sticker, feel free to call or walk in to <a href=\"https://thehub.lyft.com/hours/illinois\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">your local

Even if you haven’t been able to load a wheelchair in the past, it might be worth a try with these tips.</p>\n<p>Once the passenger is safely in their seat, ask for device storage instructions before disassembling a wheelchair. Most wheelchairs will fit in your trunk or backseat, so consider keeping a blanket in your vehicle to lay over your seats.</p>\n<p>Wheelchairs are typically <strong>foldable</strong> or have a <strong>rigid frame</strong>.</p>\n<h4>Foldable wheelchairs</h4>\n<p>You’ll usually need to remove the seat cushion before folding the chair. Your passenger may want to hold onto their chair, so ask them first.</p>\n<h4>Rigid-frame wheelchairs</h4>\n<p>Ask the passenger where the eject button is on the bigger wheels. Tilt the chair to one side, press the button, and pull the wheel from the frame. Repeat this on the other side, but be careful to avoid getting spoke lubricant on your hands.</p>\n<p>If the rigid frame fits in your trunk, lay it next to its wheels. Otherwise, buckle it into one of your back seats. Some rigid-frame wheelchairs may even fit on a seat with the front wheels in the foot cubby.</p>\n<p>If you have a hatchback car, it might be possible to store a rigid-frame chair alongside two passengers without disassembling the chair. Fold down one half of your back seat, then lock the wheelchair’s back wheels. Now load the chair into your trunk on its side.</p>\n<center>\n<p><a href=\"#top\">Back to top</a></p>\n</center><hr>\n<h2>\n<a name=\"fit\"></a>If a wheelchair doesn't fit</h2>\n<p>Sometimes, larger wheelchairs can’t be accommodated.

The policy has a $50,000 maximum limit per person, $100,000 maximum limit per accident, and a $25,000 maximum limit for property damage. There is no deductible under this policy.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> This policy may be modified to comply with specific city or state insurance requirements.</p>\n<center>\n<p><a href=\"#top\">Back to top</a></p>\n</center><hr>\n<h3>\n<a name=\"duringride\"></a>Coverage when ride accepted through ride ends</h3>\n<p>Our primary liability insurance is designed to act as the primary coverage <strong>from the time you accept</strong> a ride request until the time the <strong>ride has ended in the app.</strong> There is $1,000,000 of coverage per accident. Note: If you already carry commercial insurance (or personal coverage providing specific coverage for ridesharing), Lyft’s policy will continue to be excess to your insurance coverage.</p>\n<h4>How does contingent collision coverage work?</h4>\n<p>Our contingent collision coverage is designed to cover physical damage to your vehicle resulting from an accident as long as you have obtained collision coverage on your personal automobile policy. The contingent collision coverage will apply up to the actual cash value of your vehicle or cost of repair, whichever is less, with a $2,500 deductible. This coverage is designed to step in regardless of whether or not you're at fault.</p>\n<h4>How does contingent comprehensive coverage work?</h4>\n<p>Similar to our contingent collision coverage, our contingent comprehensive coverage is designed to cover physical damage to your vehicle resulting from a non-collision event (for example a fire, vandalism, a natural disaster, etc.) as long as you have obtained comprehensive coverage on your personal automobile policy. The contingent comprehensive coverage will apply up to the actual cash value of your vehicle or cost of repair, whichever is less, with a $2,500 deductible. This coverage is designed to step in regardless of whether or not you're at fault.</p>\n<h4>What does UM/UIM mean and how does this coverage work?</h4>\n<p><span>In the event of an accident (once you have accepted a ride or are transporting a passenger) with a driver who is uninsured (UM) or underinsured (UIM) and is ultimately at fault for bodily injury caused to you and/or your passengers, UM/UIM coverage would apply. </span> <font color=\"#172b4d\"> The availability of UM/UIM coverage and the coverage limits vary by state </font> <font color=\"#333d47\">.</font> <span> There is no deductible on this coverage.</span><span></span></p>\n<center>\n<p><a href=\"#top\">Back to top</a></p>\n</center><hr>\n<h3>\n<a name=\"when\"></a>When do these coverages apply?</h3>\n<p>It depends on the coverage.

      "body": "<p><em>At this time we’re only rolling this feature out to some Lyft users.</em> <br><br>When you’re in a hurry, sometimes you need a Lyft quicker than you think. We've added a new feature that lets you sync your phone's calendar with the Lyft app to see upcoming event locations. Whether you need to run across town for your child’s piano recital or make it to that interview in time, you can stay in the Lyft app to find where you need to go.<br><br><strong>How do I add my calendar to my Lyft profile?</strong> <br><br>First, make sure you have the current version of Lyft. The app will prompt you to grant Lyft access to your iPhone or Android’s in-phone calendar. While other calendar apps are not directly supported at this time, any calendar apps (like Google Calendar) that you have synced with your phone’s calendar will still appear in the Lyft app.<br><br>By tapping \"Allow,\" Lyft will automatically let you choose addresses from your calendar when adding destinations.<br><br><strong>How does Lyft know where I’m going on my calendar?</strong><br><br>Your calendar event must have at least a street address and zip code, though city and state can help with accuracy. <br><br>Lyft uses your calendar only to show:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Events that are currently in progress</li>\n<li>Events that will occur in the next hour</li>\n<li>Up to three events </li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>How many calendar events will Lyft register?</strong> <br><br>Lyft will only check for a week's worth of calendar events at a time. <br><br><strong>I’ve added an event to my calendar but it’s not showing in Lyft. What gives?</strong> <br><br>Lyft will only return calendar events that include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A valid street address</li>\n<li>A zip code <strong>or</strong> both city and state </li>\n</ul>\n<p>If your event has an address and you still don't see it, give the app five minutes to register your event. If the event still doesn't show after five minutes, try shutting down the app and turning it back on. <br><br><strong>How do I turn off the calendar feature?</strong> <br><br>If you need to turn off the calendar destinations feature, you can do so from your phone's Settings application.<br><br>For <strong>iPhones</strong>:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Open the Settings app on your iPhone</li>\n<li>Tap \"Privacy\"</li>\n<li>Tap \"Calendars\"</li>\n<li>Toggle off for the Lyft app </li>\n</ol>\n<p>For <strong>Androids</strong>:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Open the Settings app on your Android phone</li>\n<li>Tap \"Applications\"</li>\n<li>Tap \"Application Manager\"</li>\n<li>Tap the Lyft app</li>\n<li>Tap \"Permissions\"</li>\n<li>Toggle off Calendar for the Lyft app</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>I turned off the calendar destinations feature but I'm still seeing events. How come?</strong><br><br>When you turn off the calendar destinations feature no new calendar events will be seen in the Lyft app; however, events seven days from when you last used Lyft while the feature was turned on will still be visible. Once you turn the feature off, no further calendar events will be synced with Lyft beyond this seven-day period, and all old data will be removed. </p>\n<p> </p>"

However, if a passenger asks you to pick them up at a busy intersection and you can't sit and wait, give them a call and ask them how long it may take for them to come out. You can either circle the block or wait somewhere else until they call to confirm that they are outside.

Passengers often feel uncomfortable if you ask for their number, or to be their Facebook friend. If passengers are interested in staying in touch, it is up to them to ask for your contact information or offer you theirs.</p>\n<p><strong>Check out some pro-tips for interacting with passengers:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>It helps to be professional. We always emphasize being friendly, but there is such a thing as being too friendly. Keep conversation light, and follow the passenger's lead.</li>\n<li>We recommend that you do not take personal calls while driving. A phone call-free ride creates a friendlier and more welcoming environment for passengers.</li>\n<li>We advise that you avoid discussing sensitive subjects such as dating, politics, religion, and sexual orientation.</li>\n<li>Some passengers are looking for a quiet, peaceful ride and may not want to talk. You may not want to force a conversation with a quiet passenger.</li>\n<li>Discrimination of any kind is not allowed on the platform. Feel free to read more about our <a href=\"https://help.lyft.com/hc/en-us/articles/115012923767\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">anti-discrimination policy</a>.</li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We’re committed to holding each other accountable.

Simply tap the phone icon to start your call.</p>\n<p><strong>Passengers won't see your actual phone number.</strong> We use a third-party service to hide phone numbers in the app, so passengers won't see your personal info (and you won't see theirs).</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>\n<p><strong>Why aren't my phone calls going through to my passengers?</strong> Be sure to use the same phone registered to your Lyft account. Your phone number is saved on the 'Settings' tab.</p>\n<p>Another common reason this happens is caller ID is blocked on your phone. You must turn on caller ID to reach passengers through the app.</p>\n<p>If you've checked your phone number and caller ID but still can't make calls, tap 'Contact Support' below. We're happy to help.</p>\n<p><strong>Why can't I use the app while I'm on the phone?</strong> Some wireless networks don't allow smartphones to multitask (like using apps and talking on the phone at the same time). You'll still be able to call your passengers, but you'll leave the app when doing so.</p>\n<p>Don't worry: your ride data won't be lost.
